# ü´Ä Heart Dissection Lab

A visually guided anatomy lab exploring the internal and external structures of the mammalian heart. This project serves as an educational resource for students and educators studying basic cardiac anatomy through dissection.

---

## Overview

This project documents a systematic heart dissection with annotated visuals and concise descriptions. Designed for biology students and educators, it provides a practical understanding of cardiovascular anatomy, enhancing traditional textbook learning with real-world visuals and labeled references.

Whether you're preparing for an anatomy exam or guiding a classroom dissection, this resource is intended to clarify and simplify heart structure identification.

## Key Features

- üì∏ **Labeled Visuals** ‚Äî High-resolution dissection images with clearly marked anatomical parts  
- üß† **Concept Reinforcement** ‚Äî Supports theoretical learning with practical identification of heart components  
- üß™ **Hands-On Focus** ‚Äî Guides students through a tactile learning experience aligned with core biology curricula  
- üìã **Observation-Oriented** ‚Äî Encourages active note-taking and comparison of visual vs. expected anatomy  
- üßº **Beginner-Friendly Layout** ‚Äî Clear sections and terminology for those new to anatomical labs

## How It Works

1. **Prepare your tools and environment**  
   - Wear gloves and apron  
   - Set up a clean dissection tray  
   - Use a preserved mammalian heart (e.g., sheep)

2. **Start with the external anatomy**  
   - Locate the **right and left atria**, **auricles**, and **ventricles**  
   - Observe the heart‚Äôs general structure and orientation

3. **Proceed with internal examination**  
   - Make careful incisions with a scalpel or scissors  
   - Open the chambers to view **valves**, **septum**, and internal linings  
   - Compare observed structures with anatomical expectations

4. **Use the visuals provided**  
   - Refer to labeled images for accurate identification  
   - Cross-check with your own dissection findings

5. **Document your observations**  
   - Note differences between chambers  
   - Record unusual findings, structural clarity, or anomalies

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab, learners will be able to:

- Accurately identify major external and internal heart structures  
- Understand the spatial relationship between atria, ventricles, and auricles  
- Differentiate between right and left sides based on visual and structural cues  
- Build foundational knowledge applicable in medicine, nursing, and biology education
